How to Update a Fork in Github

Access your forked repository on Github.
Click “Pull Requests” on the right, then click the “New Pull Request” button.
Github first compares the base fork with yours, and will find nothing if you made no changes, so, click “switching the base”, which will change your fork to the base, and the original to the head fork. Now you should see changes where your fork needs to play “catch up”.
Click “Create Pull Request”, give it a name, click “Send Pull Request”.
Click “Merge Pull Request” and “Confirm Merge”.
Assuming you had no changes, you can then merge automatically.
